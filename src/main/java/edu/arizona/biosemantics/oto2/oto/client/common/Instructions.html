				<li style='padding-bottom: 10px;'><font class='font-text-style'>
						<b style='color: green'>Categorize terms</b> <br /> To categorize
						terms into the right category, select terms and drag the arrow
						that is associated with them onto the category box. <br /> Only
						the arrow can be dragged. <br /> Click the 'Save Decisions'
						button on top-right to save your decisions. You can save multiple
						times. <br />
				</font></li>
				<li style='padding-bottom: 10px;'><font class='font-text-style'>
						<b style='color: green'>View/Change your decisions</b> <br /> If
						you click the category name, you will be able to view all the
						terms that have been categorized. <br /> You may change the terms
						by dragging the arrow in front of the term into another category
						that you think is more suitable. <br /> You can also drag the
						term out of the category panel to uncategorize the term if you
						think there is no suitable category. The removed term will
						automatically go back to the left 'Terms' panel. <br />
				</font></li>
				<li style='padding-bottom: 10px;'><font class='font-text-style'>
						<b style='color: green'>Create a new category</b> <br /> By
						clicking the 'New Category' button on the top-right of category
						panel, you can create a new category that is not in the current
						category list. You will need to provide a definition for the
						category you created. <br />
				</font></li>
				<li style='padding-bottom: 10px;'><font class='font-text-style'>
						<b style='color: green'>Make a copy of a term</b> <br /> If a
						term belongs to two or more categories, you can Ctrl+drag
						(Command+drag on MAC) the term to another category to make a copy
						of the term. The term will be renamed with an additional index
						such as 'term_1', 'term_2'. <br /> Please notice that once you
						save the copied terms, they cannot be deleted. <br />
				</font></li>
				<li style='padding-bottom: 10px;'><font class='font-text-style'>
						<b style='color: green'>View term locations</b> <br /> Since
						there may be multiple copies of each term, you can view the
						locations of each copy in the 'Locations' tab. <br /> The list
						contains both the saved copies and the newest unsaved copies on
						the page. We recommend users to check existing copies of a term
						before creating a new copy of that term since saved copies cannot
						be deleted once they are submitted to the database. <br />
				</font></li>
				<li style='padding-bottom: 10px;'><font class='font-text-style'>
						<b style='color: green'>Make synonyms</b> <br /> After
						categorizing the terms, if two terms are synonyms or the same, you
						can make them synonyms or merge them together by dragging one term
						onto a second term. <br /> The term you are dragging must be
						single (have no synonyms). To drag terms with existing synonyms,
						click on the ' <font
						style='color: blue; text-decoration: underline;'>x</font> ' sign
						behind the synonym to break them to single terms, then drag them
						to the target term one by one. <br /> If there are too many terms
						in one category box, you will need to use the auto-scroll function
						to look for the target term during dragging. To use auto-scroll,
						first drag a term and hold on to it (don't release the mouse
						button). Move the cursor up until the position of the cursor is
						outside of the category box or move the cursor down until it is
						outside of the category box to make the scroll bar go down. Once
						you find the target term, move the cursor back to the category
						box. The scroll bar will freeze if the cursor is inside the
						category box. You may then drop the term to make synonyms. <br />
						Notice that only the arrow can be dragged. <br />
				</font></li>

				<li style='padding-bottom: 10px;'><font class='font-text-style'>
						<b style='color: green'>View context/glossary</b> <br /> To view
						the context or glossary, click the term name. The context/glossary
						will show up in the Locations/Context/Glossaries panel at the
						bottom of page. Click the 'Context' and 'Glossaries' tab to view
						the content you want. <br />
